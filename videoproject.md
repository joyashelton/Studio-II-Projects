Description: For this project, we were required to research a topic from a provided list and make a 2-4 minute video. The topics were all related to the Internet in some way, whether it was a monumental person, an app/website or a concept. I chose a digital life because I find it interesting how we present ourselves on the Internet versus real life. I researched using our library databases and finding stories from peoples experiences with being deceived online and being catfished. Once I gathered my research, I began looking for pictures and clips that would fit with my narration. I compiled everything on Premiere Pro and posted it to Youtube.
