Description: I used this project for two classes – Social Media and Studio II. For my social media class, we had an option between doing a research paper or posting a challenge on social media for 20 days. In Studio II, my professor wanted us to take on an independent project and learn something new. I decided to challenge myself by learning or creating something new in Adobe Illustrator and post my progress for 20 days. I created videos of my process and posted them to TikTok. I followed tutorials, traced art from my sketchbook, and took inspiration from Instagram to create all of my smaller projects. It was challenging to be creative everyday and dedicate a specific amount of time to draw, record myself, and then edit and post it. Unfortunately, I started to fall behind so I would have to draw multiple things in one day and post multiple times a day to catch up. I even had to skip days 13 and 14 because I got behind on other classes as well. Despite my challenges, this was a fun project and I enjoyed learning a new program on my own.
